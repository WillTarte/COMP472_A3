## Repository
The repository can be found at https://github.com/WillTarte/COMP472_A3
## How to run
 - All the code necessary to meet the requirements of the assignment is written into 2 files: utils.py & naive_bayes.py.  
 - utils.py is a file containing some utility functions to read and clean the data.  
 - naive_bayes.py is where the BOW NB classifier is implemented and where the main code is written.
 - To run it, simply use the command line within the repository and run `python naive_bayes.py`. You should see output in the console, and output files should be generated. Make sure that the datasets are at the same level as the python files, and are named the same as what was given through the assignment on moodle.
